###Bash Shell Software Development Toolkit

  **BBSDTK** is a set of script utilities that are designed to expediate the development of shell scripts for the _Bash_ shell. They are not meant to be fast. But, they are meant to be flexible and powerfull. Relying on as few external tools as possible for maximum compatibility. Also, providing functions that are common in other programming languages. This includes things like _leftTrim_, _caseUpper_. Maybe even someday _Object-Oriented Programming_. Please note that this is the second incarnation of my script tools and not all of the prior stuff has been ported into this toolkit yet. I just haven't gotten to that stuff yet. When I have time I do intend on bringing in the _multi-threading_ and other yet to be included pieces. However, things like the XML parsing are so slow, I don't know if I will ever finish those sections.
