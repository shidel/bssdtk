###Bash Shell Software Development Toolkit

  **BBSDTK** is a set of script utilities that are designed to expediate the development 
of shell scripts for the _Bash_ shell. They are not meant to be fast. But, they are meant 
to be flexible and powerfull. Relying on as few external tools as possible for maximum 
compatibility. Also, providing functions that are common in other programming languages.
This includes things like _leftTrim_, _caseUpper_. Maybe even someday 
_Object-Oriented Programming_. Please note that this is the second incarnation of my 
script tools and not all of the prior stuff has been ported into this toolkit yet. I just 
haven't gotten to that stuff yet. When I have time I do intend on bringing in the 
_multi-threading_ and other yet to be included pieces. However, things like the XML 
parsing are so slow, I don't know if I will ever finish those sections.

Initial build testing was done on Mac OS Lion and openSuSE 12.1. However, current testing
is only being done on Mac OS X Yosemite, openSuSE, and CentOS.
